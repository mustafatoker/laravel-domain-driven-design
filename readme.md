# Laravel - Domain Driven Design 

> Implement Domain Driven Design in Laravel Project

This project aims to structuring Laravel for large projects. 

As the project grows, the **routes/web.php** file is quite complicated so I implemented the annotation route. Anyway you can still use **routes/web.php** if it makes you more comfortable or if you don't see the value behind this.
